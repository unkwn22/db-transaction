There is quite a difference between selecting from SQL to NoSQL databases. Moreover, there are significant differences between a associated table schema and a normalized schema.

### Associated Tables
- Associated table hold keys from two or more related table's. It "Associates" relations. So if this table is lost, there is no way one can figure out each table's relations.
- Associated tables are commonly used when two or more tables have a @Many To Many relations but not limited.
- Associated tables are used when each table has its own perspective on the data values. Meaning it is architected to only store data values of its characteristics.
  - ex) If there are two tables called "Book" and "Author", "Book" only store column and data values representing "Book", so as it is for the "Author". 
- Following up with the third statement, due to it having its own perspective, it is also commonly used to resolve complexity relationships between tables. They streamline the representation of relationships without introducing data redundancy.
- Furthermore, using associated tables simplify complex queries and accommodates to a flexible data models

### Normalized Tables 
- Normalized tables, rather having associated tables for each (tables), each table with a relation to another contains their information and index values.
- Normalized tables have strict relational integrity with each tables due to the use of key constraints. It ensures consistency and accuracy in data relationships.
- Normalized tables are used to organize data efficiently by minimizing redundancy and reducing update anomalies, leading to improved data consistency and integrity.
- Therefore, it may introduce to query complexity and potential performance overhead due to joins across normalized tables.
  - Denormalization) In certain cases, denormalization may be necessary to optimize performance or simplify queries.

In my view, while both associated tables and normalized tables offer valuable approaches to organizing relational data, the choice between them ultimately depends on the specific requirements and constraints of each project. While normalized tables prioritize data consistency and integrity, associated tables offer flexibility and simplicity in managing complex relationships. Additionally, judicious use of denormalization can help optimize performance without sacrificing data integrity. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers the trade-offs and benefits of each method is essential for effective database design.
